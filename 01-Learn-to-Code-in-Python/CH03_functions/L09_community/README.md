# **Community**

Getting help is a *critical* part of learning to code (and even in your day to day working as a developer). Boots and your spellbook are great first lines of defense. But, sometimes you just *need a human*. Luckily, we have an amazing Discord community full of developers and fellow students ready to help you out.

So...

1. Click the "Community" tab in the main nav at the top of the screen
2. Join the Boot.dev Discord server and sync your account
3. With your account linked up, you'll be able to chat with other learners and mentors, as well as use the `#help...` forums to ask questions. Also, if *you* help others in the Discord, you'll get Karma which will help you earn [fellowship achievements](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/0f4fa755-1ce7-468b-bf34-c1460e97bf28#).

### **Assignment**

**Enough Discord talk, back to writing code**.
In Fantasy Quest, characters lose health due to heat exhaustion. The game tracks the temperature in Freedom units (Fahrenheit), but we need to display the temperature in Celsius for players outside the US. Here's the formula to calculate the temperature in Celsius from Fahrenheit (`f`):
`5/9 * (f - 32)`
**Complete the `to_celsius` function body**. It should return the temperature in Celsius for a given Fahrenheit temperature (`f` parameter).
