# **Where to Declare Functions**

You've probably noticed that a variable needs to be declared *before* it's used. For example, the following doesn't work:

```py
print(my_name)
my_name = 'Lane Wagner'

# NameError: 'my_name' is not defined
```

It needs to be:

```py
my_name = 'Lane Wagner'
print(my_name)

# Lane Wagner
```

Code executes in *order from top to bottom*, so a variable needs to be created before it can be used. That means that if you define a function, you can't call that function until *after* it has been defined.

### Assignment

There's a bug! It looks like we are trying to call a function *before* it was defined! Run the code and read the printed error, then fix it.
You don't need to add any new functions or pass any inputs. Calling a function with empty parentheses is perfectly valid. Pay attention to where `main()` is being called.
