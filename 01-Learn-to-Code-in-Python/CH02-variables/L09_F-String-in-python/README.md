# **F-Strings in Python**

Have you ever played old-school Pokemon and chosen a funny name so that the in-game messages would come out funny?

In Python, we can create strings that contain dynamic values with the [f-string](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals) syntax.

```py
num_bananas = 10
bananas = f"You have {num_bananas} bananas"
print(bananas)

# You have 10 bananas
```

- Add an `f` to the start of quotes to create an f-string: `f"this is easy!"`
- Use curly brackets `{}` around a variable to [interpolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) (put) its value into the string.

> You can also use an f-string directly inside a `print()` call, without assigning it to a variable first. It's just a string — don't overthink it!

- **Assignment**
  Fix the bug on line 7. Use an f-string to inject the dynamic values into the string:
  - Replace `NAME` with the value of the `name` variable
  - Replace `RACE` with the value of the `race` variable
  - Replace `AGE` with the value of the `age` variable
    Do *not* "hard-code" the values into the string. For example, this is *not* the solution we're looking for (even though it happens to work in this case):
    `print("Yarl is a dwarf who is 37 years old.")`
    We need the player to see *their* values.
    > **Punctuation and capitalization matters!** Make sure your output matches the expected output exactly.
