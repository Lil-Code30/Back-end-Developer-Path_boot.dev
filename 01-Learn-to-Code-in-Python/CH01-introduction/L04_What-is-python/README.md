Hundreds of thousands of students start their coding journey right here with [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Python doesn't *have* to be your first language, but *I* think it's the best first language for most developers. It gets out of your way so you can focus on learning fundamental programming concepts.

But just because Python is simple doesn't mean it's not useful! Python is an [*extremely* popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology#1-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) language in the industry, and is well-known for:

- Backend web servers
- DevOps and cloud engineering
- Machine learning
- Scripting and automation
- etc...

On the other hand, it *isn't* known for **frontend development** or graphical user interfaces. It's *possible*, but not common.
